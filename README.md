# What is a Data Gator?

The Data Gator is an embedded system solution for wireless sensor integration and network extension. It is a custom PCB with an ESP32, uSD card holder, and various ports for sensors. In the diagram below, DGs serve as [_**Aggregators**_](https://github.com/Project-VineHeart/scarecro#aggregator), collecting data from sensors and relaying it to [_**Gateways**_](https://github.com/Project-VineHeart/scarecro#gateway) which store the data in a cloud database. From there the data is available to the user.
